# There are N Mice and N holes are placed in a straight line.
# Each hole can accomodate only 1 mouse.
# A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1. Any of these moves consumes 1 minute.
# Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.

# Example:

# positions of mice are:
# 4 -4 2
# positions of holes are:
# 4 0 5

# Assign mouse at position x=4 to hole at position x=4 : Time taken is 0 minutes 
# Assign mouse at position x=-4 to hole at position x=0 : Time taken is 4 minutes 
# Assign mouse at position x=2 to hole at position x=5 : Time taken is 3 minutes 
# After 4 minutes all of the mice are in the holes.

# Since, there is no combination possible where the last mouse's time is less than 4, 
# answer = 4.
